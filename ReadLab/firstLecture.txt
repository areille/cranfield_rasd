// INTRODUCTION

-> Purpose : analyze softwares about climate simulation and weather forecasting
-> Fortran langage to write climate simulation and weather forecasting softwares
-> created in 1957 by IBM
-> can use C preprocessor
-> FORTRAN tools useless for this study (compared to Java or C#)
-> tens of thousands of code line for climate models


// MODELS METRICS AND METHODOLOGY

-> analyze data with Photran and a SQL database

-> methods decripted but not as much shown


// RESULTS

-> table non well placed
-> table 5 : would have needed a percentage : unreadable data


// CONCLUSION

-> develop software development tools in Fortran for this domain could be difficult : 
    - lot of code lines
    - use of deprecated Fortran features
    - C preprocessor directives to handle
